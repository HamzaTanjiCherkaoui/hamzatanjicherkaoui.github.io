i hade this idea of creating a web app that will gader most used shortcuts of sofwares (mainly related to design and developpement ) , so this post will focus on the design and developpement of the application .
# Technologies :

for this project i will use Angular as a frontend framework , and firebase for creating the API that i will consume using Angular.

# the design : 

for the design of this project i used the superhero Flash as a base of the design , to interpret the speed , as if this app will increase and boost the speed of your developpement or design process ;) .

#### wireframing :

### color pallete : 
<br>
the colors that i used were inspired by flash the superhero : 
![flash ](/assets/article_images/2017-03-12-the-shortcuts-app/flash.jpg "flash")
the choice was relative to the speeding concept .
